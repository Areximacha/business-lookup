# Business Lookup

A mini build of a small React based application that searches for business details by name or ABN code.

# Project Set-up

- Navigate to the root directory
- Run 'npm install'
- Run  'npm run start' to spin up the local dev environment
- Go to 'http://localhost:8080/' in your browser to view page (it should open automatically)

- Run 'npm run build' to compile for production. The compiled app will be found in the /dist directory.

# Build choices

Limited unit testing has been included on the component level using React Testing Library. Higher level testing has not been included as mocking the API may have become time consuming.
Styling is done with css-in-js using emotion.
